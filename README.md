# Spatial-Regression-Modelling-for-Opioid-Overdose-Risk-in-Mesa-USA

This repository contains the R Markdown file and associated resources for a spatial analysis project focused on identifying opioid overdose risk in Mesa, USA. The project uses spatial regression techniques and a variety of R packages to analyze and visualize the data.

## Project Description

The opioid epidemic is a global health crisis. This project aims to identify the risk of opioid overdose in Mesa, USA, by employing spatial regression techniques. The R Markdown file contains the code for data preprocessing, spatial analysis, and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about opioid overdoses in Mesa, USA. For more detailed information on the dataset, please refer to the R Markdown file in the repository.

## Methodology

The approach to this project involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Spatial Analysis:** Utilizing spatial regression techniques to identify overdose risks.
3. **Data Visualization:** Creating maps and other visualizations to display the results.
4. **Spatial Regression:** Different spatial regression models are applied to spatially model the incidents of opioid overdose cases in different neighbourhoods. The models have different approaches to acknowledge the spatial dependence among the neighbourhoods.

## Usage

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install these dependencies using the list of libraries in the R Markdown file.
3. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio and run the chunks of code in the given order. The report is also incorporated in the R Markdown file. You may also read the `Project Report.pdf` instead.

## Dependencies
